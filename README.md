# Hey, I'm [Max Lichter!](https://iammaxlichter.com)

I’m a **Software Engineer** passionate about web development!  

</br>

Here are a couple projects I’m working on that I’m really excited about:

- **[CMS Portfolio](https://iammaxlichter.com)** – A dynamic, self-built portfolio powered by **Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase**. I designed and coded my own drag-and-drop page builder to manage content blocks (slideshow, gallery, cards, etc.) without relying on third-party CMS platforms.  

- **SportScanner** – A live sports tracking browser extension built with **React, TypeScript, CRXJS, and a Cloudflare Worker proxy**. It shows real-time NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and NCAA scores in a draggable UI bar—designed for speed, customizability, and constant background updates.  
  - Chrome: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sportscanner/bbgnljieekloahmfjejmphkjljepceid?utm_source=item-share-cb  
  - Edge: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sportscanner/fddpmdnciimggplegnemikpghofbnmdk

- **[BobaLite](https://bobalite.com)** – A full-stack **e-commerce website** for a low-calorie boba brand, built with **.NET (Razor MVC), SQLite, and custom admin tooling**. Includes product management, image uploads, stock tracking, and a custom cart + checkout flow.

- **DateSpot (Coming Soon)** – A mobile app for discovering, saving, and rating date locations, built with **React Native (Expo)** and a **NestJS backend**. Designed around map-based exploration, real user ratings, and personalized date planning.
