# Hey, I'm [Max Lichter!](https://iammaxlichter.com)

I’m a **Software Engineer** passionate about web and app development!  

</br>

Here are a couple projects I'm working on that I’m really excited about:

- **CMS Portfolio** – A dynamic, self-built portfolio powered by **Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase**. I designed and coded my own drag-and-drop page builder to manage content blocks (slideshow, gallery, cards, etc.) without relying on third-party CMS platforms.  
- **GymThis** – A mobile app that helps new and experienced gym-goers store and track all their workout information 🏋💪. **Currently 40% complete, with a planned App Store launch early next year.**
