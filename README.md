# Hey, I'm [Max Lichter!](https://iammaxlichter.com)

I’m a **Software Engineer** passionate about web and app development!  

</br>

Here are a couple projects I'm working on that I’m really excited about:

- **CMS Portfolio** – A dynamic, self-built portfolio powered by **Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase**. I designed and coded my own drag-and-drop page builder to manage content blocks (slideshow, gallery, cards, etc.) without relying on third-party CMS platforms.  
- **SportScanner** – A live sports tracking browser extension built with **React, TypeScript, CRXJS, and a Cloudflare Worker proxy**. It shows real-time NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and NCAA scores in a draggable UI bar—designed for speed, customizability, and constant background updates.
